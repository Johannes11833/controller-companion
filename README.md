# Controller Companion

Easily map controller shortcuts to an action.
The following actions are supported:
- Kill a task by its name.
- Execute a keyboard shortcut.
- Execute an arbitrary console command.

## Features
- GUI and CLI options available
- Supports a wide variety of controllers (those supported by [pygame](https://www.pygame.org))
- Runs on Windows, Linux and Mac
- Auto start on system boot (windows only for now)
- GUI app can be compiled as a standalone executable (using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org)

## How to run
- CLI and GUI versions are accessible through [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- CLI:
    - Multiple mappings can be created.
    - One or multiple input controller key combination that triggers an action can be defined using --input. The keys of one individual input combination are separated by commas, while each distinct input combination is separated by a space. 
    - One or multiple actions can be defined using either `--task-kill`, `--console` or `--shortcut`. These actions will be mapped to the previously defined controller --input key combinations in the order `--task-kill`, `--console` and finally `--shortcut`
    - Example with 2 mappings: 
    ```console
    poetry run controller_companion --input A,B Back,Left --console explorer.exe --shortcut alt+f4
    ```
    will result in the following mapping:
    ```console
    Controller<A,B> --> Action<name: Run command "explorer.exe", target: explorer.exe, type: CONSOLE_COMMAND>
    Controller<Back,Left> --> Action<name: Shortcut "alt+f4", target: alt+f4, type: KEYBOARD_SHORTCUT>
    ```

    - Run `poetry run controller_companion --help` to see all available arguments

## Build Executable
With [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed, run the following command to build the executable using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org):
```console 
poetry run build
```
